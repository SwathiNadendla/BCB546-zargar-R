Review
Overall, the code was running smooth without any errors. Great Job!
I liked your own visualisation of having SNP transistions..  the plots were really good!
I have a few minor comments about the errors that I have got 
1. The file path error was solved after you haved reviewed and committed changes. Thankyou so much for that.
2.Load all packages needed in the Markdown file as it gave me a few errors
3. NA introduction warnings were there multiple times. I believe there is something wrong about numeric position function may be you can use conditional statement to convert only numeric values or remove them before converting but didn't impact any results.
