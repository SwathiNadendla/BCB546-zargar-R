#General Comments
I had no issues running the code. I like how you have your data sorted. It is very easy to observe increasing chromosome order vs decreasing. Also, your inspection of files is very thorough Good job!

#Code
The code ran well overall and it is consise and organized by comments. The usage of sapply works very well to keep the code concise. 

#Plots
The plots are very clear. The text/captions are organized well and I see no issues.
